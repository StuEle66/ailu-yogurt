# Ailu Threat Model

## Scope

Ailu is a local Obsidian plugin that orchestrates user-installed Claude Code or Codex runtimes, local Skills, Feishu CLI operations, X Article draft automation, and a user-hosted WeChat relay. It is not a security boundary around those external programs.

## Protected assets

- Vault notes, attachments, local conversation history, and Agent Memory excerpts;
- Provider API keys, relay tokens, X cookies, Feishu login state, and WeChat AppSecret/access tokens;
- publishing intent: exact note revision, prepared HTML, images, destination, and idempotency identity;
- writer ownership and recovery evidence for `.ailu/`, `~/.ailu/`, Provider settings, and deployment state.

## Trust boundaries

1. **Obsidian and Ailu.** A malicious Obsidian plugin running as the same user may read process memory or invoke Obsidian APIs. Ailu cannot isolate itself from such a plugin.
2. **Agent CLIs and model providers.** The selected CLI receives the current request and permitted context. Its network behavior, retention, tool execution, and provider policy are governed by that CLI and provider.
3. **Local Skills and executables.** Skill content and executable paths are discovered locally. Ailu does not make unreviewed local code trustworthy merely by discovering it.
4. **Feishu.** Ailu invokes an independently installed `lark-cli`; authentication remains owned by that CLI. Only user-confirmed document operations are in scope.
5. **X.** The uploader uses a separate Playwright profile and canonical X cookies. It creates a draft but never clicks final publish.
6. **WeChat relay.** Article HTML and images leave the Mac only after confirmation and travel to the user's own `wechat-relay`. The AppSecret stays on that server. Ailu does not offer a shared relay.
7. **Image-post browser handoff.** A dedicated Chrome profile stores Xiaohongshu and WeChat web login state. Ailu can upload the frozen image set and fill copy after an explicit handoff, but it exposes no final-publish operation and preserves uncertain pages for inspection.
8. **macOS photo conversion.** Photos DNG, HEIC, and HEIF bytes are passed only to the fixed system executable `/usr/bin/sips`. Ailu does not use a shell, network converter, downloaded binary, or user-controlled executable path. The source copy lives in a private, owner-checked, per-run temporary directory and is removed after success, failure, cancellation, or timeout. Stale cleanup only removes old directories bearing Ailu's exact ownership marker beneath its private temporary root. `/usr/bin/sips` is part of macOS and is not bundled or relicensed by Ailu.

## Principal controls

- full access is opt-in and revalidated at the runtime execution boundary;
- Claude Code receives only user-level settings; inherited `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is removed for local/custom-provider runs, while a CC Switch directory must resolve through non-symlink directory components to a physical path outside the current Vault;
- Codex Plan and text-only turns are ephemeral, read-only, tool-free and network-disabled; ordinary restricted Codex turns are network-disabled, and App Server shutdown waits for the complete child process tree rather than only the parent process;
- conversation writes, Home settings, Provider records, X cookies, and deployment use process locks plus compare-and-swap or atomic replacement;
- canonical cookie directories reject symlinks, require private permissions, and accept only valid, unexpired X login cookies;
- Provider URLs are canonicalized, public HTTP is rejected, and invalid legacy profiles are quarantined from execution;
- attachment and publishing paths must remain beneath an authorized Vault root and may not traverse symlinks; Agent image inputs are copied from verified open-file bytes into private, content-addressed Ailu Home files and revalidated before runtime use;
- image-post imports reject empty or oversized files before reading their bytes, verify source signatures, bound macOS conversion to 90 seconds and 4096 pixels on the long edge, validate the resulting JPEG, and persist only the converted managed copy;
- chat, Feishu and X Markdown previews accept only frozen, verified media exposed through managed short-lived object URLs; the WeChat-only remote-image fetcher permits HTTPS port 443 and revalidates public DNS addresses, redirects, size and media type;
- remote-image work has one absolute deadline across DNS, redirects and response streaming; runtime output and generated artifacts are bounded by per-event, per-turn, item-count, byte and concurrency limits before Vault side effects;
- publishing confirmation binds the exact source hashes, rendered/prepared content, preflight evidence, destination, and token fingerprint;
- WeChat drafts are read back; X drafts require same-URL persistence, exact text/table evidence, and media identity/count/order/position evidence;
- raw logs and upload artifacts are never automatically presented as safe to share; the diagnostic exporter uses an allowlist.

## Expected residual risks

- a compromised user account, OS, Obsidian process, Agent CLI, local Skill, browser profile, or self-hosted relay can access data available to that component;
- model providers may receive prompts or attachments according to their CLI configuration;
- browser and platform UI changes can break draft automation, producing a partial draft that requires manual inspection;
- Xiaohongshu or WeChat image-editor changes can leave a partially filled page; after upload begins, interruption is treated as uncertain and is never blindly replayed;
- X and WeChat may retain uploaded drafts independently of local rollback;
- advisory same-user locks prevent accidental concurrency, not a malicious process running as the same user;
- no security claim is made for Windows writer or child-process-tree behavior; runtime execution and unsupported writer paths fail closed before spawning.

## Explicit non-goals

- automatic publishing, group sending, payments, credential retrieval on behalf of a model, or unattended account actions;
- protecting secrets from a fully compromised local user or operating system;
- hosting user AppSecrets in a shared Ailu-operated service;
- treating arbitrary downloaded Skills, provider profiles, or relay endpoints as trusted.
